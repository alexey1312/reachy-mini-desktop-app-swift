# ReachyUI

Shared SwiftUI views for all platforms (macOS/iPadOS/iOS). Depends on ReachyKit and ReachyMedia (WebRTC camera).

- Adaptive layouts, not per-platform copies; `#if os(iOS)` only for platform-exclusive APIs (Settings deep link etc.).
- `horizontalSizeClass` is unavailable on macOS — guard size-class branching with `#if os(macOS)` (always regular there).
- All robot interaction goes through `RobotSession` / `RobotBrowser` from ReachyKit — no direct URLSession here.
